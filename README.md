# Goober--The-Procedural-Python-Slicer
A slicer that generates Gcode procedurally though a few basic python scripts. Still currently in the very early stages of dev. Use at your own risk!

Very ghetto.
Feel free to mock my code.
You probably want to check the Gcode works in a slicer like Cura before you send it to a printer.
Make sure you paste generated Gcode into another file that starts the printer, like Start_Ender_3.gcode
Idk thats about it for now
